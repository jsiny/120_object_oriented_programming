What are the benefits of object oriented programming in Ruby?

- Having a cleaner code with methods organized within classes
and modules

- Avoiding numerous method parameters by using instance variables
instead

- Keeping your code DRY through inheritance of methods (less 
duplication)

- Thinking more abstractly about the problem being solved

- This helps manage complexity

- Better data protection through encapsulation
